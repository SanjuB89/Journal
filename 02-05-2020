Learned about Virtual Privagte Networks(VPN)
Learned how VPN works on a two way authentication of a pre-generated certificate creating a tunnel between two end users.
Replacing Remote desktop with VPN because in Remote Desktop you actually have to type in the ip address and the port number to connect to the server.
Using VPN we can log in with a traditional username and password to work on our server from anywhere in the world.
