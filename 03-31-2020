- Tested the webpages myself in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
- I had some image link issues I had to fix due to the mis-match of the file names. It worked in Windows but it didn't in Linux because 
for HTML it is case sensitive in Linux and not in Windows.
- As soon as the webpages were up and running, I informed my teammate Joshua to browse the website to verify everything is correct and 
presentable. 
- After he tested the webpages, I contacted the Client, Dr. Chen, to schedule an appointment for UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
