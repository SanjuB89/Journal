- Tested the webpages myself in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari.

- I had some image link issues I had to fix due to the mis-match of the file names. It worked in Windows but it didn't in Linux because for HTML it is case sensitive in Linux and not in Windows.

- As soon as the webpages were up and running, I informed my teammate Joshua to browse the website to verify everything is correct and presentable. 

- After he tested the webpages, I contacted the Client, Dr. Chen, to schedule an appointment for UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

- UAT was schedule on the 1st of April, 2020 and due to the dangers of COVID19 we had to do it remotely.

- Client is very happy with the product and is willing use the materials next semester to teach parallel programming.

- scheduled early morning appointment with my teammate to work on the recording of the presentation.

- Made sure we know how to use zoom app and easily navigate.

- conducted rehearsal before finalizing the presentation.
