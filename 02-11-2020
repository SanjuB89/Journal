Virtual Private Network (VPN) was succesfully installed and tested.
Idea is to create safe and encrypted connection from anywhere in the world to your home network
You can have devices connected to each other and control it from outside.
For example: lights, tv, computer, printer which is connected to the home local network.
For VPN, I have forwarded the port on my router to a secondary raspberry pi so that the one with the proxy doesn't get overloaded.
Installed pivpn into the raspberry pi and created a user using pivpn -a command.
Creating a user actually creates a .ovpn file in the root inside the ovpn folder.
It recommended to copy that certificate into a flash drive for security( email, sms are not secure), then import onto the device that you wish to connect from.
In windows to import this certificate into OpenVpn which you can download for free.
Once the the certificate is succesfully imported into the device, you are one click away from connecting to your local server at home.
