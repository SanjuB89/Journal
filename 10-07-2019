Met with Dr. Chen at his office with my crew.
Asked multiple questions about the network card and LAN since the 5 port network card didn't seem sufficent for the model
  were building.
Came up with an alternative solution to connect the cleint computers via wifi instead of the cable itself.
Web server is still connected through wire for better internet speed.
The homepage of the website and its links to the different courses were created and presented as a trial version.
Received more information to custom design as per Dr. Chen's needs.
