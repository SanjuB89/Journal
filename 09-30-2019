Group meeting with Dr. Chen was held at panawicz building at 11am with all our equipments ready to give our project a quick start.
Dr. Chen provided us the wireframe for the websites we're going to build.
I assigned the website building parts to my teammates:
Joshua is building the home page and Connor is building the link websites to it.
My part is Networking and get those three Raspberry pi's talk to each other for multiprocessor processing via MPI.
We meet coming Friday for updates.
