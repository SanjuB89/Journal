Met with Dr. Chen at 3:00 pm in his office to discuss more about the project and its freasiblity.
He wants his project written in C.
Since no one of us knew that language, we will teach ourselves C language
Familiarize more with Pen MP and MPI
Email Dr. Chen about the progress every week
Target for this semester was set: build dummy websites and spin a webserver using Raspberry pi on LAN to deploy the websites. Hopefully we'll have enough equipment be abe to assign a failover server too.
