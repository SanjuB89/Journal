I was using Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to remote into my server at home upto this point from any computer.
I had to type my public ip address and port number to exactly direct the connection to my home server.
I found a better and secure solution for this process.
VNC - Virtual Network Computing.
Create a free account in RealVNC and choose a free package for educatational purposes
VNC has a server (VNC server) version and client version (VNC viewer)
Raspberry Pi usually have a VNC embedded in it, therefore we have to enable it using sudo raspi-config command
install vnc server on raspberry pi, which is free of cost.
download vnc application on the client device you wish to remote in from.
Now, the logic is inorder to connect the client to server both of the devices need to be logged in as same user with same authentication. 
They connect via cloud in RealVNC not TCP/UDP
You dont have to port forward anything on your router.
