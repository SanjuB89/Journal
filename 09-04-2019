I and Joshua met up at 11am as per my request to meet up to talk to Dr.Chen.
Dr. Chen thouroughly briefed us about the project and assigned us some tasks to accomplish before we meet up again on 09-12-2019 at 3pm.
Took notes so that I can brief the Evaluater. 
I and Joshua debriefed each other to make sure we are on the same page.
Created a word document of all the notes from the meeting.
